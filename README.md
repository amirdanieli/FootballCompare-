Transfer Suggest

Full stack project that allows you to create radar charts to compare between footballer's different attributes (allowing for better decision making when comparing players to purchase). 

To create the desired chart, a user must register/log in to the site and go to the player compare page, where he can choose the desired players (up to 3 players for better visiibility) and the selected attribute. The user will then be directed to the chart page. 

This project used Python, Node.js (with express framework), HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB.
